[![.NET](https://github.com/ShirazAdam/RuntimeComposition.NET/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ShirazAdam/RuntimeComposition.NET/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)


A C# .NET 8 ASP.NET MVC web application demonstrating the concept of run time composition. Based on the original work that I did in the repository: https://github.com/ShirazAdam/Runtime-Composition.


This is an updated version for .NET 8 with ASP.NET MVC to showcase the same technique used in the .NET Framework 4.8.1.
